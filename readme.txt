==Description==

Add useful referrer information to emails sent via any Contact Form 7 contact forms on your Wordpress website. Based on the Enhanced Wordpress Contact Form plugin by Yoast.

Main features are: 
* Add website referrer(s) links. 
* Pages visited on your website. 
* Search engine keywords used (if referrer was a search engine).

==Installation==

1. Simply activate the plugin and the referrer information will automatically be added to your CF7 emails.

==Notes==

Can be modified to only replace [referrer] tags by uncommenting line 148 and commenting line 150. May be useful if you want to restrict which contact forms send referrer information and which don't.
